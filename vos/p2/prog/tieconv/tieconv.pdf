PURPOSE

     TIECONV prepares a gridded dataset for POLYGEOM, GEOMA, 
     LGEOM,  MGEOM,  GEOMV or  GEOMZ  transformations. Input
     is paired sets of tiepoints with no restrictions. It is
     in principle, a surface generation routine, but creates 
     the  gridded  dataset so as to best interface with  the 
     VICAR routines above.   The sequence GEN,  TIECONV, and 
     GEOMZ can be used to generate a surface in image format 
     through an arbitrary set of points.
     TIECONV uses the finite element method  (triangulation) 
     for  surface  fitting.   It is anticipated  that  other 
     surface  fitting methods will be integrated into  VICAR 
     in  the same fashion as tieconv so that users will have 
     maximum flexibility both in terms of choice of  surface 
     fit and in terms on application.
     The triangulation method is Thiessen triangulation. The
     maximum number of points is  probably  about 1 million.
     The largest case  tried so far is 400,000 points, which
     ran in 4 hours 31 minutes on a SUN SPARCstation 20.
     
     TIECONV can be used to prepare a polynomial surface fit
     of four types.  The keyword is POLY  and  it  has  five
     values: "LINEAR","KEYSTONE","QUAD","CUBIC", (or ""  for
     triangulation).  LINEAR fits the  best plane (in the L2
     norm or least squares) through the x-distortion and the
     y-distortion.   KEYSTONE fits a  bilinear surface, QUAD
     fits a general quadratic surface and CUBIC fits  a gen-
     eral cubic surface.  The  number of  tiepoints required
     are LINEAR - 3, KEYSTONE - 4, QUAD - 6, and CUBIC - 10.
     More tiepoints  are handled  by a least squares fit.

OPERATION

     tieconv operates in two phases.   In phase 1, the input 
     points  are  fully  triangulated  by  a version  of the 
     Thiessen   algorithm.   This operates by  computing the
     Voronoi polygons (polygons of area  nearest each point)
     and  computing  the  triangles  formed by the bisectors
     of the  polygons.   Four extra points  are  added  five 
     diameters away from the convex hull so that the surface 
     will extend smoothly beyond the input tiepoints.

     In  phase 2,  the output grid is formed by  evaluating 
     the  triangular surface at grid point locations.   That 
     is,  a grid point will fall in some triangle,  and  the 
     GEOM  shift  will  be the linear interpolation  of  the 
     input shifts at the three corners of the triangle.  The 
     user  should  note  that  the  triangular  surface   is 
     continuous but not differentiable and it passes through 
     all  of  the input  points.   Point-surface  generation 
     routines can e compared in the following table.

     POLYGEOM INP=X PARMS=B OUT=Y

     In this example,  the tiepoints are used to set up a 44 
     x  24 grid for use by POLYGEOM.   The tiepoints can  be 
     scattered  over  the  image  in  any  fashion   whereas 
     POLYGEOM requires a regular grid.
     
     TIECONV can be used to prepare a polynomial surface fit
     of four types.  The keyword is POLY  and  it  has  five
     values: "LINEAR","KEYSTONE","QUAD","CUBIC", (or ""  for
     triangulation).  LINEAR fits the  best plane (in the L2
     norm or least squares) through the x-distortion and the
     y-distortion.   KEYSTONE fits a  bilinear surface, QUAD
     fits a general quadratic surface and CUBIC fits  a gen-
     eral cubic surface.  The  number of  tiepoints required
     are LINEAR - 3, KEYSTONE - 4, QUAD - 6, and CUBIC - 10.
     More tiepoints  are handled  by a least squares fit.
     
     
     Back to the  triangulation case, if the  input data set
     is a  grid, or  approximately  a  grid, a  shortcut  is
     applied that  speeds up  enormously.  The detection  of
     the grid is automatic.

TIMING

     Timing  is dominated by the triangulation method  which 
     is 0(n*log(n)) where n is the number of input points.  A case 
     with  10000  points  was run in 1.63 minutes  CPU  time, 
     and a case with 400,000 points was run in 4.52 hours on
     a SPARCstation 20.
     
     If the input data set is a grid, or approximately a grid,
     a shortcut is applied that speeds up enormously.  The
     detection of the grid is automatic.
     
     The polynomial fits (LINEAR, KEYSTONE, QUAD, CUBIC) are
     very fast.
     
RESTRICTIONS

   The maximum number of input tiepoints is probably about 1 million.
   This value will increase as the machines get more virtual and
   real memory since dynamic memory allocation is used throughout
   the algorithm.
   
   The maximum number of output tiepoints is limited by IBIS table
   size (currently about 10 million?).  Internal to the program,
   dynamic memory allocation is used.

                         dataset will be an IBIS file.  Note
                         that GEOMV no longer  requires  the
                         NAH or NAV keywords.

     GEOMA               this  keyword  specifies  that  the

                         and  format so that  no  additional 
                         parameters  need  to  be  specified 
                         unless desired.

                         cautioned    to    observe    LGEOM 
                         application size limitations.

                         output is to be formatted for MGEOM 
                         use.   The output disk dataset will 
                         contain  proper MGEOM keywords  and 
                         format   so   that  no   additional 
                         keywords   need  to  be   specified

                         fails to find a grid.
.VARIABLE POLY
    POLY=LINEAR     LINEAR fits a linear surface through
                    the x-distortion and the y-distortion
                    using least squares.  This requires at
                    least three input data points.  More
                    tiepoints will be handled with a least
                    squares fit and the residuals can be 
                    viewed.  All input output formats are 
                    valid with these options except for PLOT.

   POLY=KEYSTONE    KEYSTONE fits a bilinear surface through
                    the x-distortion and the y-distortion
                    using least squares.  This requires at
                    least four input data points.  More
                    tiepoints will be handled with a least
                    squares fit and the residuals can be 
                    viewed.  All input output formats are 
                    valid with these options except for PLOT.

   POLY=QUAD        TIECONV can be used to prepare various
                    polynomial fits.  For a general quadratic
                    fit of the form x' = ax^2+bxy+cy^2+dx+ey+f
                    y' = gx^2+hxy+iy^2+jx+ky+l, use the 
                    keyword QUAD, which requires six tiepoints.
                    More tiepoints will be handled with a least
                    squares fit and the residuals can be 
                    viewed.  All input output formats are 
                    valid with these options except for PLOT.

   POLY=CUBIC       TIECONV can be used to prepare various
                    polynomial fits.  For a general cubic
                    fit of the form
                    x' = ax^3+bx^2y+cxy^2+dy^3+ex^2+fxy+gy^2
                         +hx+iy+j
                    y' = kx^3+lx^2y+mxy^2+ny^3+ox^2+pxy+qy^2
                         +rx+sy+t      use the
                    keyword CUBIC, which requires ten tiepoints.
                    More tiepoints will be handled with a least
                    squares fit and the residuals can be 
                    viewed.  All input output formats are 
                    valid with these options except for PLOT.
.VARIABLE PLOT
    PLOT=PLOT            bypasses tiepoint generation phase.
    or 'PLOT             creates graphics file of triangula-
                         tion for plotting.
.VARIABLE PRINT
    'PRINT		 Keyword to print informative data.
.VARIABLE GRIDTOL
If the input is a grid (and no poly keywords are used) the
program is sped up by a huge factor.  The grid is detected
automatically and has a tolerance for points being out of
regularity on the grid.  Each point is predicted by its two
previous neighbors and the distance from the predicted to
the actual is ratioed to the neighbor grid distance.  GRIDTOL
is the maximum ratio allowed.

Failure to find a grid due to this parameter causes the 
program to apply thiessen triangulation to the point set
which can be slower by a factor of hundreds.

You can be generous with this parameter, say 10 or 20, but
keep it smaller than the nah or nav by half.  The row or 
column that is found must match the length of the other rows
or columns and (nah+1)*(nav+1) must equal the total number of
points.
