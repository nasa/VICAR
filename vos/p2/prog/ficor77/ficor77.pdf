"ficor77" -- Voyager radiometric correction program
.HELP
PURPOSE:

ficor77 is a Vicar applications program which removes vidicon camera
induced radiometric distortion from Voyager images.

EXECUTION STATEMENT:

    ficor77 INP=(PIC,C1,C2,...,D1,D2,...) OUT=OPIC  user-parameters...

The input files consist of the image to be corrected (PIC), radiometric
files (C1,C2,...) as generated by the program MJSPFCF, and dark-current
frames (D1,D2,...).  PIC must appear as the first input.  The remaining
input files may appear in any order.  At least one radiometric file and
dark-current frame must be specified.

PIC must be an 800x800 (geometrically uncorrected) Voyager image in byte
data format.  The dark-current may consist of a single frame or the sum
of multiple dark-current exposures (byte or halfword format).  If a
summed dark-current is input, the parameter NUMDC must be used to
specify the number of frames summed together.

The output file (OPIC) consists of the radiometrically corrected image.
OPIC is normally output in halfword data format.  To specify byte or
floating point output data format, use the OFORMAT parameter to specify
BYTE or REAL.

.page
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

"ficor77" will radiometrically correct the input image, converting the input
DN values to some specified radiometric unit.  The program requires a
radiometric file containing calibration data acquired via the same camera
and filter position as the input image (PIC), and dark-current data acquired
via the same camera and scan-rate.

The dark-current (offset) consists of thermally induced charge which must
be subtracted from the signal.  This charge accumulates on the vidicon,
and increases linearly with time.  Dark-current build-up occurs during the
time between frame erasure and read-out.  It is therefore a function of
image scan-rate.  Also, simultaneous-exposure wide-angle frames will have
a greater dark-current build-up than normal-exposure frames since they
are read out during the next frame cycle (the narrow-angle frame is read
out first).

To measure the dark-current, zero-exposure (dark-current) frames are
acquired during cruise and encounter.  Because the rate of dark-current
build-up is time variant and highly sensitive to temperature changes,
the user should specify a dark-current frame with an FDS time reasonably
close to the FDS time of the input image.

The radiometric file contains calibration data obtained from a light-transfer
sequence (see program MJSPFCF for details).  For each pixel, the file
contains the nominal camera output S0,S1,S2,...,Sn (in units of DN) at each
of a sequence of exposures E0,E1,E2,...,En (in foot-Lambert-msecs).

The data samples S0,S1,S2,...,Sn are stored in the file for the low-gain
state, and have been scaled up by a factor of 9 as a result of application
of a 3x3 low-pass filter (used to suppress shot noise).  The dark-current
is subtracted from these data samples before insertion into the file.
(See the documentation of VICAR program MJSPFCF for details).

The first record of the radiometric file contains the number of data points
in the file (n), and luminance values L0,L1,L2,...,Ln corresponding to
exposures E0,E1,E2,...,En for a reference shutter speed of 1 second.
The remaining records contain the data samples Si for each pixel.  Each
ordered pair (Li,Si) comprises a data point on the light-transfer curve which
characterizes that pixel's response to exposure to a light source.

.page
OPERATION:

"ficor77" assumes that the first input file is the image to be radiometrically
corrected (PIC).  Upon entry, "ficor77" extracts the camera ID (serial number),
filter position, gain-state, scan-rate, and camera mode from the input picture
label.  (These values may be overridden via optional parameters CAMERA,
FILTER, GAIN, SCAN, and MODE.)

The remaining inputs are a list of radiometric and dark-current files, which
may appear in any order.  The program automatically selects the correct
radiometric file and dark-current frame by scanning this list for a radiometric
file with matching camera ID and filter, and a dark-current frame with matching
camera ID and scan-rate, as indicated in the picture labels for these files.
(The camera ID, gain-state, scan-rate, and operating mode obtained from the
dark-current picture label may be overridden via optional parameters DCCAM, 
DCGAIN, DCSCAN, and DCMODE.)

For each pixel of the input image, the radiometric correction process
consists of the following steps:

  1) The DN values D and DC for the pixel are extracted from the input
     image and dark-current frame respectively.  If the input image
     (or dark-current) was taken in high-gain, the DN value is converted
     to equivalent low-gain DN by dividing by the gain ratio (see GAIN
     parameter).  The pixels are also scaled by 9 (see DIV parameter) to
     match the scale of the samples in the radiometric file.  If the
     input dark-current frame represents a sum of multiple dark-currents,
     the dark-current DNs are scaled by dividing by the number of frames
     summed together (see NUMDC parameter).

  2) The dark current is removed:  S = D - DC

  3) The resulting signal (S) is converted to luminance:  A piece-wise
     linear model of the light-transfer function is used, such that each
     data point (Li,Si) is assumed to lie on the curve, and the curve is
     assumed to be linear between data points.  Let
		S  < S < S
		 i        i+1
     The signal is converted to luminance by interpolating between the
     data points:

		    L    - L 
		     i+1    i
		L = -----------(S - S ) + L
		    S    - S         i     i
	             i+1    i

     where L is in units of foot-Lamberts.

  4) The output pixel is scaled to radiometric units R (Ref. 4).  The
     user determines the output picture scale by specifying one of the
     following (see IOF and CONV parameters.):

	A1 = number of 'I over F' units per DN, where 10,000 I/F units
             would be produced by normal incidence of sunlight on a 
	     a Lambert disk at the planet's distance from the sun.

 	A2 = number of nanowatts per cm**2 per steradian per nanometer
             wavelength per DN.

     If A1 is specified, then

		        to     S1	
		R = L * --- * ---- * (D/5.2)**2
			 t     A1
     where

	to = reference shutter speed of the data points (msec),
	t  = shutter speed of the input image (msec).
	S1 = filter-dependent conversion factor from ft-Lamberts to
	     I/F units for a reference distance of 5.2 AU from the Sun.
	D  = planet distance from the Sun (in AU).  D is 5.2 AU for Jupiter,
	     9.51 AU for Saturn, 19.122 AU for Uranus, 30.21 AU for Neptune.

     For Voyager 2, the planet-of-encounter is determined by searching the
     frame label for a valid PICNO, Spacecraft-Event-Time (SCET), or Earth-
     Received-Time (ERT), in that order.  This may be overridden via the
     PLANET keyword.

     For Voyager 1, the planet-of-encounter is always set to Jupiter, and this
     may not be overridden.

     NOTE: Prior to March 1988, the correction for solar distance (D/5.2)**2
     was not applied, and all frames were scaled to Jupiter's distance from
     the sun.  The program "fixvgr" was used to scale the frames to Saturn or
     Uranus, and to correct for errors in the ground calibration values of
     S1 (see below).

     If A2 is specified, then

			 S2
		R = L * ----
			 A2

     where S2 is the filter-dependent conversion factor from ft-Lamberts
     to units of nanowatts/cm**2/steradian/nanometer.

     For images taken during ground calibration, the keyword LC should be
     used to specify Xenon light-cannon (rather than solar) illumination.
     Values for S2 are retrieved from tables stored in the program for
     each camera-filter combination for both solar and light-cannon
     illumination.

  5) The output DN is converted to the specified data format.  For byte
     output, the DN range is ALWAYS 0 to 255.  Values outside this range are
     truncated to 0 or 255, as appropriate.   For halfword (16-bit integer)
     and real output, the default range is -32768 to +32767 (i.e. the full
     halfword range).  Although a negative DN value has no physical meaning,
     this may occur if the dark-current frame has a higher dark-current
     level than that of the input image.  Negative DNs may be set equal
     to zero via the NONEG keyword.  The upper limit may be modified
     via the MAXDN parameter.

.page
OUTPUT SCALE CORRECTION:

As of March 1988, the output DN scale is corrected using factors derived
from analysis of calibration plaque data (see Ref. 4) and comparisons with
ground-based data (see Ref. 5).  This scale correction may be suppressed
via the NOCORRECT parameter.

The following scale correction is applied to each pixel:

			R' = S*R

where the constant S is a function of camera and filter position.
S is retrieved from a table stored in the Scale Correction File (SCF).
This file may be specified by the SCF parameter.  (Note: The constants
in the file have the target-to-Sun distance correction built into them).

The scale correction is identical to the correction applied by program
"fixvgr", except that "fixvgr" rescales the output DN values to 1 'IOF' unit
per DN.  Images which have been scale-corrected by "ficor77" need not be
processed by "fixvgr".  If processed by "fixvgr", no re-scaling is done unless
the constant has been changed.  Images scale-corrected by "ficor77" may be
identified by the following picture label:

  (e.g) COMMENT=' PICTURE MULTIPLIED BY  0.93   FICOR	2/02/86 VERSION'
	SCALE='URANUS'

where 0.93 is the constant S, URANUS is the planet-of-encounter, and
2/02/86 is the version date of the SCF.  See the help file for program
"ficorgen" for source documentation of the current and past scale correction
values.

.page
EXAMPLES:

"ficor77" is most commonly used as follows:

	ficor77 (PIC,CAL,DC) OPIC GAIN=0

The calibration file (CAL) must be for the same camera and filter as PIC.
The dark-current file (DC) must be for the same camera and scan-rate.
The output frame (OPIC) will be in halfword (16-bit integer) format.

The value of IOF is chosen to maximize use of the output 16-bit DN range
(0-32767).  The default value for IOF (IOF=1) is appropriate for most
targets.  For targets of low albedo (e.g. Saturn's rings), IOF is chosen
within the range  0.01 < IOF < 1.0.

Most of the remaining parameters are used to work around occasional errors
in picture label information.  Since high-gain images were acquired for
only a small percentage of VGR-1 Jupiter frames, the parameter GAIN=0 is
regularly used to override the camera gain-state value to low-gain.

ERROR MESSAGES:

All error messages are preceded by three asterisks (***).  An error is fatal
only if it is immediateley followed by the message:
		"***FICOR task cancelled"

TIMING:

"ficor77" requires 21 CPU seconds on the VAX 8600.  It will complete within
30 seconds (wall-clock) on a single-user system and about 3 minutes on a
system supporting 20 users.  The program reports its progress by printing
the line count at 100-line intervals.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
	INP=(PIC,C1,C2,...,D1,D2,...)
The input files consist of the image to be corrected (PIC), radiometric
files (C1,C2,...) as generated by the program MJSPFCF, and dark-current
files (D1,D2,...).  PIC must appear as the first input.  The remaining input
files may appear in any order.  At least one radiometric and dark-current
file must be specified.

PIC must be an 800x800 (geometrically uncorrected) Voyager image in byte
data format.  The dark-current may consist of a single frame or the sum
of multiple dark-current exposures (byte or halfword format).  If a
summed dark-current is input, the parameter NUMDC must be used to
specify the number of frames summed together.

If more than one radiometric file are specified, "ficor77" will select
the correct file by matching the camera serial number and filter position,
as extracted from the VGR frame label.  If more than one dark-current file
are specified, "ficor77" will select the correct file by matching the camera
serial number and scan-rate.
.VARIABLE OUT
    Ex:	OUT=OPIC
The output file (OPIC) consists of the radiometrically corrected image.
OPIC is normally output in halfword format.  Use the OFORMAT parameter
to specify BYTE or REAL output.
.VARIABLE SIZE
    Ex: SIZE=(sl,ss,nl,ns)
The standard Vicar size field (starting line, starting sample, number of
lines, number of samples).
.VARIABLE FILTER
	Ex: FILTER=4
Specifies the camera filter position for the input image.  The filters are
mounted on an 8-position filter wheel as follows:

	#  Narrow-Angle   Wide-Angle
	-  ------------   ----------
	0  Clear	  Methane (J-S-T)
	1  Violet	  Blue	  
	2  Blue		  Clear
	3  Orange	  Violet
	4  Clear	  Na-D
	5  Green	  Green
	6  Green	  Methane (U)
	7  Ultraviolet	  Orange

This parameter overrides the filter position extracted from the label of
the input image.  Note that the filter position must agree with the
filter position of the radiometric file.
.VARIABLE SCAN
	Ex:  SCAN=5	(specifies 5:1 scan-rate)
Specifies the scan-rate of the input image.  Valid scan-rates are 1,2,3,5,
and 10.  This parameter overrides the scan-rate extracted from the label
of the input image.  Note that the scan-rate of the input image must agree
with the scan-rate of the dark-current frame.
.VARIABLE DCSCAN
	Ex:  DCSCAN=5	(specifies 5:1 scan-rate)
Specifies the scan-rate of the dark-current frame.  Valid scan-rates are 1,2,3,]
5, and 10.  This parameter overrides the scan-rate extracted from the label
of the dark-current frame.

.VARIABLE CAMERA
  Ex: CAMERA=4
Specifies the camera ID (serial number) of the input image (PIC).  This
overrides the camera ID extracted from the image's picture label.  The
camera serial numbers of the Voyager spacecraft are:

	4 = VGR-2 WA		6 = VGR-1 WA
	5 = VGR-2 NA		7 = VGR-1 NA

The camera ID for the input image must agree with the camera ID of the
radiometric file and dark-current frame.
.VARIABLE GAIN
Specifies the camera gain-state of the input image (PIC).  This overrides
the camera ID extracted from the image's picture label.  Valid values are:
	GAIN = 0  for low gain
	GAIN = 1  for high gain
The calibration data in the radiometric file are stored for the low-gain
state only.  If high-gain images or dark-current frames are input, the
DN values are converted to equivalent low-gain DN by dividing by the
gain-ratio between high and low gain for the appropriate camera:
		S/N 4   -   3.7642
		S/N 5   -   4.2531
		S/N 6   -   3.9424
		S/N 7   -   3.9240
.VARIABLE DCCAM
  Ex: CAMERA=4
Specifies the camera ID (serial number) of the dark-current frame.  This
overrides the camera ID extracted from the picture label of the dark-current
frame.  The camera serial numbers of the Voyager spacecraft are:

	4 = VGR-2 WA		6 = VGR-1 WA
	5 = VGR-2 NA		7 = VGR-1 NA
.VARIABLE DCGAIN
Specifies the camera gain-state of the dark-current frame.  This overrides
the camera ID extracted from the picture label of the dark-current frame.
Valid values are:
	GAIN = 0  for low gain
	GAIN = 1  for high gain
.VARIABLE NONEG
Specifies that all resultant DNs which are negative will be set to zero.
This keyword is a relic of the IBM days.  At one time, GEOMA would die
whenever it ingested a negative DN.
.VARIABLE MODE
Overrides the camera mode extracted from the input picture label.  Valid
values are:
      MODE     TITLE
       1      NOSHUT
       2      NA ONLY
       3      WA ONLY
       4      BOTALT
       5      BSIMAN
       6      BODARK
       7      BOTSIM
.VARIABLE DCMODE
Overrides the camera mode extracted from the picture label of the dark-
current frame.  Valid values are:
      MODE     TITLE
       1      NOSHUT
       2      NA ONLY
       3      WA ONLY
       4      BOTALT
       5      BSIMAN
       6      BODARK
       7      BOTSIM
.VARIABLE NUMDC
	NUMDC=n
Specifies that the input dark-current represents the sum of n dark-current
exposures.
.VARIABLE EXPO
Specifies the exposure time of the input frame in milliseconds.  This value
overrides the exposure time extracted from the input picture label.
.VARIABLE IOF
	IOF=r
where r specifies the output DN scale in number of 'I over F' units per DN.
10,000 'I over F' units would be produced by normal incidence of sunlight
on a Lambert disk at Jupiter's distance from the sun (5.2 A.U.).
Default is IOF = 1.0.  If CONV is specified, do not specify IOF.
.VARIABLE CONV
	CONV=r
where r specifies the output DN scale in number of nanowatts per cm**2 per
steradian per nanometer wavelength per DN.
The default is IOF=1.0 and CONV is calculated.  If IOF is specified, do not
specify CONV.
.VARI PLANET
KEYWORD--OPTIONAL
Specifies the planet-of-encounter.  Valid values are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
or Neptune.

For Voyager 1, the planet-of-encounter is always set to Jupiter, and this
keyword is ignored (only Jupiter scale factors are available for VGR-1).

If defaulted for Voyager 2, the planet-of-encounter is determined by
searching the frame label for a valid PICNO, Spacecraft-Event-Time (SCET)
or Earth-Received-Time (ERT), in that order.  If the fifth character of the
PICNO is a 'J','S','U', or 'N', this is accepted as a valid planet ID.
Otherwise, if the SCET or ERT year is greater than 74, the planet is determined
as follows:

	YEAR		PLANET	   VGR-1 Encounter   VGR-2 Encounter
	--------	------	   ---------------   ---------------
	less than 80	Jupiter	     Mar  5 79		Jul  9 79
	80 to 84	Saturn	     Nov 12 80		Aug 25 81
	85 to 87	Uranus				Jan 24 86
	88 and beyond	Neptune				Aug 24 89
.VARIABLE SCALE
	SCALE=s
Used to specify the output DN scale.  SCALE is currently not implemented as
either IOF or CONV is in effect.
.VARIABLE AUTO
Specifies automatic scaling of the output DNs.  AUTO is currently not
implemented as either IOF or CONV is in effect.  AUTO activates a FICOR77
mode which scans the input picture, sampling every tenth line to
determine the mean DN of the picture.  The program selects the appropriate
value of SCALE in order to output a picture with a mean DN approximating
the mean DN of the input picture.
.VARIABLE THRESH
THRESH is an integer specifying the lower threshold to be used in the
computation of the mean DN (see AUTO keyword).  Since AUTO is not
implemented, THRESH has no effect.
.VARIABLE OFORMAT
OFORMAT is a keyword which specifies the data format of the output picture.
Valid values are BYTE, HALF, and REAL, where
	 BYTE specifies 8 bit integer format.
	 HALF specifies 16 bit integer format.
	 REAL specifies floating point format.
The default is HALF.
.VARIABLE MAXDN
 MAXDN specifies the maximum DN in the output
 picture.
 Default is : 255 for byte data
              32767 for 16-bit or real data
.VARIABLE LC
LC specifies the xenon light-cannon as the light source for the input image.
(The light-cannon was used during ground camera calibration).  If not
specified, solar illumination is assumed.
.VARIABLE NOCHECK
NOCHECK specifies that no label checking will be done to match the camera
parameters between the input frame (PIC) and the radiometric file and dark-
current frame.  The radiometric file is assumed to be the second input file
and the dark-current frame is assumed to be the third input file:
	Ex:  INP=(PIC,CAL,DC)
If defaulted, "ficor77" will attempt the find a radiometric file from the
same camera and filter, and a dark-current frame from the same camera and
scan-rate.  The program will terminate (ABEND) if unsuccessful.
.VARIABLE DIV
The DN values in the radiometric file are scaled by a factor n due to
application of a low-pass filter (of unit weights) on the frames input to
program MJSPFCF.  DIV is used to specify this scaling:
	DIV=n
where n is an integer specifying the number of pixels in the filter area.
Normally, a 3x3 filter window is used so DIV=9.  If DIV is not specified,
the scale factor is determined from the picture label of the radiometric
file.
.VARIABLE NOCORREC
KEYWORD--OPTIONAL
Valid: 'NOCORREC
Specifies that no scale correction is to be done.  If both 'NOCORRECT and
'NONEG are specified, the output image is the same as the input image except
that all negative DNs have been set to zero.  If 'NOCORRECT is specified but
'NONEG is not specified, the output image is an exact copy of the input
image.  In practice, the NONEG and NOCORRECT keywords are no longer used.
.VARIABLE SCF
STRING--OPTIONAL
	Ex:  SCF="MIPL:[MIPL.VGR]VGRSCF.DAT"
Specifies the Scale Correction File, as generated by program "ficorgen".
Note that since this file is rarely updated, the default usually points to
the most recent file and this parameter is normally not specified.
