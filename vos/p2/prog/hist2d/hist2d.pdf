VICAR PROGRAM HIST2D

PURPOSE and OUTPUT FILE DESCRIPTION

HIST2D will generate a two-dimensional histogram file from a VICAR file of 
three dimensions. The two-dimensional histogram file has as its Y-axis (lines) 
the range of DN values of the input file or such values scaled for radiance or 
reflectance, I/F, and as its X-axis (samples) the input's band numbers.  Thus 
each line of the histogram file represents the frequency of a data number (DN) 
through all the bands of the input file.  A sample slice through all the lines 
of the histogram file represents a one-dimensional histogram for a band of the 
input file. Please note the values of the Y-axis decrease from their maximum to
zero as file line number increases. Band number of the X-axis increases as file
sample number increases.  This provides a common origin for both DN or scaled
DN value and band dimensions.
.page
OUTPUT FILE DESCRIPTION continued 
  
The frequencies of each band's histogram are represented by the pixels or data 
numbers (DNs) of the file, corresponding to the number of occurrences of DN, I/F
or radiance values in the input file. Histogram data numbers have a range of 
either (0,255) or (0,32767), depending on the output data format specified by 
the user.  Frequencies are normalized to 255 for byte output format and 32767 
for halfword output format.
.page
EXECUTION

To execute the program HIST2D, the following syntax should be used:

	HIST2D   INP   OUT   user-parameters

where INP is the three-dimensional (3-D) VICAR format file used to generate the 
two-dimensional (2-D) histogram output file, OUT.  

.page
USER PARAMETERS - SUMMARY

User parameters consist of the histogram range (LIMITS), format of output data 
(FORMAT), input file windowing parameters (SL,SS,SB,NL,NS,NB), incrementing 
values for various input file dimensions to speed execution of histogram 
(SINC,LINC,BINC), a parameter to exclude or include the input file data number 
value of 0 in the histogram range (EXCLUDE), parameters to control the output 
size (OUT_NL,OUT_NS), a parameter to replicate sample values (band numbers) 
to fit in the vertical dimension (REPLICATE), a parameter to define the y-axis
scale of the two-dimensional histogram (DN, IOF, RAD) and a parameter to take
the logarithm of the two-dimensional histogram values to increase resolution
(LOG).
.page
USER PARAMETERS

LIMITS

This allows the user to restrict the data values of the input file used to 
generate the two-dimensional histogram output file.  Valid limits for byte
input data should be between (0,255).  Valid limits for halfword input data
should be between (-32768,32767).  Defaults: (0,255) for byte; (0,32767 for 
halfword; (-32752,32767 for halfword of calibration type RADIANCE or IOF,
which correspond to the ISIS "Special Values" range.

The range specified by the limits parameter is then mapped into the number of
output lines in the file, such that an output file of 512 lines with limits
(-32768,32767) would map 32768 values into 512 discrete units.  DN values 
between -32768 and 0 are accumulated for each band's histogram and added to the
zero (0) DN value frequency of the respective histogram.

RLIMIT

This sets a lower limit to valid floating point (REAL*4) data, which can be
useful for treating ISIS data which assigns the lower end of the range to
"special values".  Note that this is platform-dependent;  the default
(0xFF7FFFFA) is for IEEE floating point.

.page
USER PARAMETERS continued

FORMAT 

Allows the user to specify an output file of data type byte (BYTE) or halfword
(HALF).  The default is BYTE.

SINC, LINC, BINC

Sample, line, and band increments are used to control the amount of the input 
image file used in the calculation of the two-dimensional histogram.  The
default for all incrementations is one (1).

.page
USER PARAMETERS continued

SL,SS,SB,NL,NS,NB

Starting line, starting sample, starting band, number of lines, number of 
samples and number of bands are used to control what portion of the image file
is used to compute the two-dimensional histogram.  The default is for all 
starting values to be one (1) and the number of (NL, NS, NB) values are the
values obtained by XVGET of the input file.

OUT_NL, OUT_NS

These control the output file (two-dimensional histogram) dimensions of 
number of lines and of samples.  OUT_NS should not be smaller than the
number of bands specified for the window of the input file bands. The
defaults are OUT_NL=512 and OUT_NS=512.

.page
USER PARAMETERS continued

DN, IOF, RAD

The output file's y-axis may be scaled in raw DN, IOF or radiance (RAD).
If RAD or IOF is specified, the following label items must be found 
in the history labels of the input file: "CAL_TYPE='RAD'", "RAD_CONV",
"RAD_BASE", and "SOLAR_F".  These items make possible the conversion 
between DN and radiance and IOF.  Radiance and Solar Flux must be provided 
in units of uWATT/cm**2/micron/steradian.  The default keyword is DN.
.page
USER PARAMETERS continued

LOG,NOLOG

This keyword controls whether or not the logarithm is taken of the DN's of the
output file, the two-dimensional histogram.  Default keyword is LOG.

TEST, NOTEST

These keywords control whether or not a test histogram file and screen display 
are produced which are used for verification of the correct operation of the 
program.  This option is for the software developers' and testers' use.  The 
following are output to screen: band number at which maximum DN occurs in 
histogram plot; scale of the Y-axis in terms of DN per pixel; scale of 
histogram file's DN to histogram's frequency axis.
.page
EXECUTION EXAMPLES

VICAR> HIST2D  IO_LIMB.IMG  IO_LIMB.HST  FORMAT=HALF LIMITS=(123,3000)

The above example takes input file IO_LIMB.IMG and generates a 2-D histogram 
file, IO_LIMB.HST, of data format HALF.  Data numbers -32768 to 122 and 3000 to 
32767 are not included in the generation of the histogram.  In this case the
resolution of the Y-axis will be (0,4096).  HIST2D follows HICCUP.COM handling 
of halfword inputs, except negative halfword values are included in the scaling
of the output.  A convenient maximum value for the Y-axis is chosen based on 
the maximum DN value found in the input file which happens to be less than the 
upper value of the user specified LIMITS parameter.  IF THE LOWER LIMIT IS LESS
THAN ZERO, the absolute value of that lower LIMIT is added into the maximum.
This maximum is always a multiple of 256 in the DN mode of operation.  Please 
note that DN 0 is not always the Y-axis origin for halfword data; the origin
is the lower LIMIT value.  LIMIT defaults are (0,255) for byte; (0,32767) for
halfword data; and (-32752,32767) for halfword data of calibration type RADIANCE
or IOF.
.page
EXECUTION EXAMPLES (continued)

VICAR> HIST2D  JUPITER_LIMB.IMG  JUPITER_LIMB.HST  'EXCLUDE SL=20 SS=120 NB=201

This example takes input file JUPITER_LIMB.IMG and generates a 2-D histogram
file, JUPITER_LIMB.HST, of default data format BYTE.  If the input file is
of data format BYTE, the histogram range of bin DNs is (1,255) because of the
EXCLUDE parameter.  Byte data allows the user specified range endpoints to be 
mapped to 0 and 511 on the Y-axis of the two dimensional histogram.  The bin 
size is 255/512 or 0.498, thus mapping the 255 values into 512 bins.   
Finally, HIST2D, because of "SL=20 SS=120", ignores the first 19 lines and 
first 119 samples of each band of the input file JUPITER_LIMB.IMG.  Also, due
to "NS=201", only bands 1 through 201 are included in the processing.  
.page
VICAR LABELS OF 2-D HISTOGRAM FILE

In order to provide the necessary information to a display routine or mask 
program, a number of VICAR label items are added to the histogram file.  These 
items include the input file data number (DN) range of the histogram (LIMITS - 
revised depending on the EXCLUDE parameter value), the incrementing values of 
the input file dimensions (INC_LSB - LSB is an acronym for line, sample, band), 
the input file windowing parameters (WINDOW - array of SL,SS,SB,NL,NS,NB), and 
the input file name of HIST2D (INP_FILE).  MAXDN is also a label item which
describes the DN, IOF, or RAD value that represents the maximum pixel value
of the y-axis of the two histogram.  All these label items provide sufficient 
information to properly display the two-dimensional histogram.
.page
POSSIBLE ERROR CONDITIONS

The program HIST2D does not accept two-dimensional files as inputs.  That is to
say that input files must have at least two bands to be processed; otherwise the
program aborts.  Also, input files must be of data format BYTE or HALF.  Other 
forms of input will result in a program abort.  
.page
BIN CALCULATION

For the users' benefit, the following formula is used to calculate the appro-
priate bin in which a byte input file data number (DN) will fall.

	BIN_size = [UPPER_limit - LOWER_limit + 1] / OUT_NL

	BIN 	 = [INPUT_data_number - LOWER_limit] / BIN_size

where 	UPPER_limit is the upper limit of the histogram range (units - DN),
	LOWER_limit is the lower limit of the histogram range (units - DN),
	OUT_NL is the number of lines in the histogram file (default is 512),
	BIN_size is the size of the bin (units - DN),
	INPUT_data_number is the data number to be placed in a bin, and
	BIN is the bin number of the INPUT_data_number (0,511).
