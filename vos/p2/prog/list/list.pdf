 Print the DN values of an image area

 PURPOSE:
 LIST will give a numerical listing of a VICAR dataset.
 It offers a large assortment of print formats and input data formats.
 All parameters except INP are optional. Only the first four characters of
 string parameters (other than INP) are checked by the program.
 Caution should be used in defaulting the SIZE parameter as this will result
 in the entire picture being listed. For a 900 x 900 byte picture, this
 would tie up the line printer for 30 minutes.

 If the keyword DUMP is specified, the output may be a tape data set.
 If DUMP is not specified, the data set is listed in vertical strips
 30 pixels wide.  Since this will generally result in multiple
 passes through the data, the picture should be on a disk data set.
.page
 LIST can handle unlabeled files if the parameter INSIZE is given.  The
 input file format and organization is taken from the FORMAT and ORG
 parameters, if present.

 The maximum record size (number of samples * pixel size) that LIST
 can handle is 200,000 bytes.  If you try to list even just a part
 of an image that is bigger than 200,000 bytes, you will get an error.

 EXECUTION:
    The following is the execution statement for LIST:
            LIST  INP  SIZE  PARAMS
 where INP, SIZE, and PARAMS are parameters discussed in their
 respective parameter section in TUTOR mode.

.VARI INP
 Standard VICAR1 input dataset parameter.
.VARI SIZE
 Standard VICAR1 image size parameter.
.VARI BANDS
 Standard VICAR1 band size parameter.
.VARIABLE FORMAT
 The value of the FORMAT keyword specifies the (LOGICAL) input data format
 and the resulting print format. The actual input data format is obtained
 from the image label, if available.
  FORMAT   INPUT FORMAT      PRINT FORMAT
    HEX      BYTE          Hexadecimal and alphanumeric
    BYTE     BYTE          30 3-digit integers per line

    REAL4    REAL*4        10     "       "     "   "     Synonym for REAL
    REAL8    REAL*8        10     "       "     "   "     Synonym for DOUBLE
    DOUBLE   REAL*8        10     "       "     "   "
    COMPLEX  COMPLEX*8     10     "       "     "   "
 If FORMAT is not specified, the information is obtained from the image label.
 If the information is not in the label, byte data are assumed. FORMAT also
 controls the number of bytes per sample of the SIZE,SINC,SS and NS parameters,
 or the BANDS,BINC,SB, and NB parameters if the organization is BIP.

 nb. HEX - not available for DOUB or COMP inputs.  If the input file in not 
	   Vicar formatted, it is recommended that the file is input as byte
	   format. 
.VARIABLE LINC
 The value of LINC (integer) specifies the line increment: every LINC-th line
 will be printed, starting with the first.
 Default: LINC = 1.
.VARIABLE SINC
 The value of SINC (integer) specifies the sample increment: every SINC samples
 of a line will be printed, starting with the first. 
 Default: SINC = 1.
.VARIABLE BINC
 The value of BINC (integer) specifies the band increment: every BINC-th band
 will be printed, starting with the first.
.VARIABLE INCREMEN
 The value of INCREMEN (integer) specifies the line AND sample increment:
 every INCREMEN samples of of every INCREMEN line will be printed,
 starting with the first.
 Default: INCREMEN = 1. 
.VARIABLE DUMP
 This parameter has one valid keyword value: DUMP.
 
 If DUMP is specified, a line-by-line listing will be produced, 
 i.e., all elements on a line within the area specified by the 
 SIZE parameter will be listed before proceeding to the next line.
 
 If DUMP is NOT specified (default), the listing format will be 
 that described in the program documentation, i.e. formatted for
 a line printer.
.VARIABLE ZEROES
 This parameter has one valid keyword value: ZEROES.
 
 If ZEROES is specified, lines containing all zero values are printed.
 
 If ZEROES is NOT specified (default), lines containing all zeroes will
 not be printed.
.VARIABLE NOEJECT
 This parameter has one valid keyword value: NOEJECT.
 
 If NOEJECT is specified, the printing of labels and column headings
 in all but the first page of each strip is suppressed.
 
 If NOEJECT is NOT specified (default), labels and column headings
 are repeated each page.
.VARIABLE SPACE
 The value of SPACE (integer) specifies the spacing between lines in the
 output listing.
 Default: SPACE = 1.
.VARIABLE NDIGITS
 The number of significant digits (2-16) to be displayed for real numbers 
 (REAL, DOUBLE and COMP).
 Default: NDIGITS = 4.
.VARIABLE DISPLAY
 This parameter has one valid keyword value: DISPLAY.
 
 If DISPLAY is specified, the spacing of the output is adjusted so that
 the aspect ratio of the listing is the same as the aspect ratio of the
 image.
 It is suggested that this option only be used if FORMAT is BYTE or HALF.
 
 If DISPLAY is NOT specified (default), the default spacing is used.
.VARIABLE NOFEED
 This parameter has one valid keyword value: NOFEED.
 
 If NOFEED is specified, then the form feed that normally separates
 each strip is suppressed.  This allows much more compact printing of
 images with many samples but only a few lines.

 The default behavior (if NOFEED is not given) is to issue a form feed
 before every strip of printing, only in batch mode.  If LIST is run
 interactively, no form feed is ever generated.
.VARIABLE NOUSRTIM
 This parameter has one valid keyword value: NOUSRTIM.
 
 If NOUSRTIM is specified, then the username and datetime that is
 normally displayed from the label is suppressed.  This allows 
 comparison of regression test logs without the need to filter out the
 username and datetime, which change from run to run.

 The default behavior (if NOUSRTIM is not given) is to include the
 username and datetime from the label in the listing.
.VARIABLE ORG
 This parameter has three valid keyword values: BSQ, BIL, and BSQ.

 ORG specifies the organization that the file will be printed in.  The
 meaning of bands, lines, and samples does not change with different
 organizations; they are just printed in a different order.  Sample
 number 1 in line 2 and band 3 will always be sample 1, line 2, and
 band 3 under any organization, although it might be printed in a
 different place.

 If ORG is not specifed (default), the input file organization is used.

 You may not do both organization conversion and format conversion at
 the same time unless one (or both) of these conditions are met:

 1.  You are converting from BSQ to BIL or vice versa.

 2.  The output format has the same number of bytes as the input
     format, e.g. HEX<->BYTE, FULL<->REAL, or DOUBLE<->COMPLEX.
.VARIABLE INSIZE
 The size of the input file if it has no label.  If the input file
 has a label, then this parameter is ignored, and the actual file
 size is used.
