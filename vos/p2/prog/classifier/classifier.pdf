VICAR/IBIS Program "classifier"

PURPOSE

 This program classifies the pixels of the input images into the
 classes defined by the classibis file.  The class file may be
 generated from ustats or clusterer program.  The input files should be
 same type and order (i.e. band 1, 2, 3,...) that the classibis file
 was generated as.  There is one output file and another optional
 output file.  The first output file consists of the class # that the
 pixel was classified into.  The second optional output file consists
 of the euclidean distance between the pixel and the mean of the class
 it got classified into.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
 Input image files

.VARIABLE OUT
 Output image files
 The first output file
 is the class # the
 pixel got classified
 into.  The second
 output file consists
 of euclidean distance
 between the pixel
 and the mean of its
 class.

.VARIABLE CLASSIBIS
 IBIS file containing
 the classes.  This file
 is usually generated
 from ustats, stats,
 or clusterer program.
