VICAR program srchedge


.HELP
PURPOSE:
	To find the angle in degrees of the transition edge of an input image.  
	The transition edge is the line at which a vast difference in DN
	values is found.

EXECUTION:
        
	srchedge inp=in.img out=out.img angle=angle [optional-parameters]

METHOD:

        INPUT IMAGE:

        Only black and white halfword VICAR images are valid.	The input
	image has only dark and light DN values with one side of the image
	dark and the other light.  A distinctive straight line created by
	the transition edge from dark to light or light to dark separates
	the two values.

        PROCESSING:

        Srchedge does the following:

                1) Finds the transition edge where the dark DN value
                   and the light DN value come together.
                2) Creates an output image file that is the same as the
		   input file except the transition edge is marked with DN
		   values of 20,000.
                3) Does a least squares fit on the points making up the
	           transition edge.
                4) Gets the angle of the line created by the least squares
		   fit and returns it in parameter angle.

	The angle is measured as follows:

		1) Preliminary angle A is obtained such that -90.0< A <=90.0
		2) Then there are 6 cases:
			A. Dark side on left  and A>0   =>  angle = 360.0 - A
			B. Dark side on right and A>0   =>  angle = 180.0 - A
			C. Dark side on left  and A<0   =>  angle = 180.0 - A
			D. Dark side on right and A<0   =>  angle = -A
			E. Horizontal w/ dark on top    =>  angle = 180.0
			F. Horizontal w/ dark on bottom =>  angle = 0.0

	Note:  A local variable of type real for parameter angle must be
	       declared by the user.

HISTORY:
Oct 24, 1997	RRD	Improved help section.  Fixed bug on Solaris by
			changing variable cut from unsigned int to int.
			Commented out line in fitpts that calculates sigma
			because it generates DOMAIN error. 
Jul 22, 1997	RRD	Ported to UNIX.
Mar 28, 1996  Y Kwon	Wrote original version.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
1 input VICAR image.

.VARI OUT
1 output VICAR image.

.VARI SKIPNS
Number of samples to skip in
searching for transition edge.

.VARI SKIPNL
Number of lines to skip in 
searching for transition edge.

.VARI DARKSKIP
Number of lines and samples to 
skip in calculating the average
DN of the image.

.VARI SMALL
Indicates whether the entire 
image will be searched.

.VARI SMALLSIZE
Indicates the portion of the 
image which will be searched.

.VARI CUT
Shortens the search area of 
the image.

.VARI ANGLE
Output angle in degrees of 
transition edge.  Parameter
is of type real.

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
The input VICAR halfword image must be black and white and have a darker and
a lighter side.

.VARI OUT
The output image will the same as the input image except that the
transition edge points will be highlighted with a DN of 20,000.

.VARI SKIPNS
This variable designates the number of samples to skip while incrementing
through each input image line to find the transition point form dark to
light or light to dark.

.VARI SKIPNL
This variable designates the number of lines to skip while incrementing
through each input image column to find the transition point form dark to
light or light to dark.

.VARI DARKSKIP
This variable designates the number of lines and samples to skip while
incrementing through the input image to calculate its average DN value.

.VARI SMALL
Indicates whether the entire image or a portion of the image
(indicated by SMALLSIZE) will be searched.  When SMALL is set to 
'SMALL', SMALLSIZE is used.  When SMALL is set to 'NORMAL', 
SMALLSIZE is ignored.

.VARI SMALLSIZE
Indicates the portion of the image which will be searched.
SMALLSIZE must be smaller than the input image size.

.VARI CUT
Another means to shorten the search area of the image.  For example, when
CUT is set to 100 the top-most and bottom-most 100 lines, as well as the
left-most and right-most 100 samples, are ignored in the search for the
transition edge.

.VARI ANGLE
The angle in degrees of the transition edge is output to this parameter.
The user must declare a variable of type real to receive this value.
