.TITLE
VICAR Program LABEL
.HELP
LABEL is a VICAR program, designed for both interactive and batch
use, which can be used to create, remove, list, and modify in
various ways the labels in a VICAR file.  It is designed to replace
all old IBM VICARlabel processing programs (LABCAT, VLABEL etc.) and
add additional capabilities.

When LABEL is invoked on the command line, the mode of operation
is determined by the subcommand which is used.  For help on the
subcommands and the general operation of LABEL, type TUTOR LABEL.
.page
Limitations:  The VICAR label items are in the form of "keyword = value".
If the value is of the string type, there is a limitation on the maximum
string length depending on the operating systems.  At current time, the
maximum string length is limited to 132 characters, including white spaces 
(the Solaris OS constraint).  Users need to be aware the program does not 
warn users if the maximum string length is exceeded.

.SUBCMD ADD
LABEL-ADD is used to add one or more label items to an image's history
or property label, or to add one or more label elements to a currently
existing label item.  The items are given as a list in a quoted string,
separated by either spaces or commas.  Each item must be given in the
form "keyword(element) = value-list", where "keyword" is the keyword
of the label, "(element)" is the OPTIONAL starting element number, and
"value-list" is a single value or a list of values enclosed in parentheses.
If a value in "value-list" is a string, it should be contained in single
quotes.  If the value is an integer, real or double-precision value,
it is given as is.

If both an input and an output file are given, then the output file
label is modified and the data is copied to it.  If only an input file
is given, then the input label is modified and no output file is created.

Normally, attempting to add a keyword that already exists causes an error.
However, if the 'UPDATE keyword is turned on, the keyword will be replaced
if it already exists.
.page
Examples:

LABEL-ADD infile outfile "SLOPE = 3, COMMENT='Hello' COORD=(32.5,59.96)"

would add the integer keyword SLOPE with a value of 3, the string
keyword COMMENT with the value contained in the single quotes,
"Hello", and the real keyword COORD with the two values 32.5 and
59.96 to the current task label, the LABEL history subset.
The input file is not modified.

LABEL-ADD infile outfile "COUNT=2, TARGET='NEPTUNE'" PROPERTY=MYPROP

would add the integer keyword COUNT with a value of 2 and the string
keyword TARGET with the value "NEPTUNE" to the property label set
named "MYPROP" (first instance).  The input file is not modified.
.page
Examples (cont.):

LABEL-ADD infile +
          ITEMS="DN = 255 COMMENT = 'All lines are black' LIST(2)=(37,42)" +
          TASK=INSERT INSTANCE=2

would add the integer keyword DN with a value of 255, and the 
string keyword COMMENT with the value 'All lines are black'
to the second occurence of the INSERT history subset in the
input file.  If the keyword LIST existed previously in the label,
then elements 2 and 3 would be added, with the values 37 and 42,
respectively.  The old element 2 would become element 4, i.e. the
new elements are inserted into the item.  If LIST did not exist
previously, it would be created with two elements with values 37
and 42.  Since no output file is given, the input file is modified,
and no output file is produced.
.VAR INP -ADD
INP specifies the name of the input file.  The input must have a valid
VICAR label.

Note:  If no output file name is given, the input file's label will 
be modified directly.
.VAR OUT -ADD
OUT is the name of the output file to which the data and the modified
label are to be written.

If OUT is omitted from the command line, the label items are added to
the input file directly.
.VAR ITEMS -ADD
The label items which are to be added. The items are given as a
list in a single string parameter, in the form

key(element)=value-list

where "key" is a valid (0 - 8 character) label keyword, "element"
is an optional starting element number (an integer), and "value-list"
is the list of values to be associated with that keyword.

The operation differs slightly depending on whether or not the
starting element number is given.

If the element is not given, i.e. the item is of the form
"key=value-list", then the entire label item is affected.  The
indicated keyword is added to the label, with one or more values
specified by "value-list".  If the keyword already exists, an
error message is produced (unless UPDATE is turned on, in which
case the keyword is replaced).
.page
If the element is given, then only parts of the label item are
affected.  If the keyword currently exists in the file, then the
indicated values are inserted into it, starting at element number
"element".  For instance, if the label item "LIST" had three values
(1,2,3), and the following was in the label-add ITEM string:
"LIST(2)=(10,11)", then values 10 and 11 would be inserted into
LIST starting at position 2.  The new value of LIST would be
(1,10,11,2,3).

If the element is given, but the keyword does not currently exist
in the file, the element number is ignored and a new label item
is created containing the values in "value-list".
.page
A value of -1 for the element number indicates the end of the label
item, i.e. all elements will be appended to the end of the item.

If the same keyword appears twice in "value-list", each is treated
independently, i.e. the first one is used, then the second one.  If
the first one causes the number of elements or the relative position
of an element to change, the second one uses the NEW positions, values,
and number of elements.
.page
"Value-list" is a list of values, enclosed in parentheses, and
separated by commas.  If there is only one value, the parentheses
are not necessary.

All of the values in "value-list" should be of the same type:
integer, real, doub(le), or string.  The type should also match the type
of the existing label, if "element" is given.  The LABEL program will
try to convert to the appropriate type, but if it can't it will give
an error.  It can convert integers to real, doub(le) or string, and 
reals to doub(le) or string.  Any other conversion is an error.

The four types are differentiated by the way in which they are
specified. Strings should be contained in single quotes.  The quotes
are not strictly necessary if there are no commas, spaces, or parentheses
in the string, but they should normally be included anyway.  Standard
FORTRAN notation for integers, reals and doub(le)s is understood. Doub(le)s
are real values with more than 6 significant digits.              

.PAGE
Examples of valid "value-list" specifications:

Specification			Meaning
-------------			-------
787				single integer
(21)				single integer
(6,-9,42)			list of three integers
+3e2				single real
-2.000001			single doub(le)
(3.14159, 2)			list of two reals.  The integer 2 is
				  converted to a real: (3.14159, 2.0)
'a string item'			single string
('another string item')		single string
('string 1','string 2')		list of two strings
('string 1', 123, 4.5, wow)	list of four strings.  The values get converted
				  to strings: ('string 1', '123', '4.5', 'wow')
.page
Using this input format, the entire list of items is input
as a single string, such as

"slope=-45.8, planet='Jupiter' avgdn = 128 coord=(86.3, 44.8)"

This string stores the real value "slope", the string value
"planet", the integer value "avgdn", and the two element real
value "coord".
.VAR TASK -ADD
The name of the task heading or history subset under which the label
item is to be stored.

The presence of TASK implies that the history label will be modified,
so TYPE is unnecessary.  If you wish to add to a property label, use
PROPERTY instead.  If neither TASK nor PROPERTY are given, and TYPE is
omitted, all labels will be placed in the history label under the
heading of the current task (LABEL if an output file is given, the
last task otherwise).

An error occurs if both TASK and PROPERTY are given, or if TASK is
given with TYPE=PROPERTY.
.VAR INSTANCE -ADD
Since the same program may be run on an image several times, it is
possible to have multiple history task headings with the same name.
Property sets may also have more than one instance (e.g. different
versions of a camera model).  INSTANCE=n is used to refer to the
n-th occurence of the named history task or property set.  If INSTANCE
is not specified, 1 is assumed.

For PROPERTY labels only, setting INSTANCE=0 will create a new instance
of the given property.  New instances may also be created by giving
an INSTANCE higher than any currently existing in the label (only one at
a time will be added), but INSTANCE=0 avoids having to determine the highest
existing instance number first.  However, each keyword in the ITEMS list
is treated independently, so if you have more than one, you'll get multiple
new property instances added if you specify INSTANCE=0!  Use with care.

If TASK or PROPERTY is not specified, then INSTANCE is ignored.
.VAR PROPERTY -ADD
The name of the property subset under which the label item is to be
stored.

The presence of PROPERTY implies that the property label will be
modified, so TYPE is unnecessary.  If you wish to add to a history
label, use TASK instead.  PROPERTY is mandatory for property labels,
so even if you say TYPE=PROPERTY you must still specify a property name.

An error occurs if both PROPERTY and TASK are given, or if PROPERTY is
given with TYPE=HISTORY.
.VAR TYPE -ADD
Specifies whether the items will be added to the HISTORY or PROPERTY
label.  TYPE is not normally needed, since the presence of the TASK
parameter implies history labels, while the presence of the PROPERTY
parameter implies property labels.  TYPE may be used for error-checking,
however, as TASK, PROPERTY, and TYPE must all agree on the type of
labels being added.

.VAR UPDATE -ADD
Normally, if elements were not specified and the keyword already exists
in the label, an error is produced.  The -REPLACE subcommand can be used
in this case, but that causes an error if the keyword does not already
exist.

The 'UPDATE keyword to -ADD mixes both subcommands.  If specified, the
keyword will be added to the label if it does not already exist, or
replaced (updated) it if it does.
!
!=======================================================================
!
.SUBCMD CONCAT
LABEL-CONCAT is used to concatenate property and/or history label sets
from input 1 into input 2.  The resultant image has the data and labels
of input 2, with selected property sets from label 1 added in.  If OUT
is specified, a new file is written, otherwise input 2 is modified in-place.

The result is similar to LABEL-SWITCH except that history/property labels
from input 2 survive the process.

Either the entire history and/or property label from input 1, or a single
property set or history task, may be transferred.  Specifying TASK or
PROPERTY will cause a single set to be transferred (in which case TYPE=BOTH
is ignored); omitting both TASK and PROPERTY will transfer the entire
history and/or property label, controlled by TYPE.

In all cases, new history tasks or property sets are created; existing
history/property sets in input 2 are not modified.

The new label sets are always added after all existing ones; there is no
facility to add sets into the middle or the beginning.  To simulate adding
sets to the beginning, add them in the other order, then use LABEL-SWITCH.
(e.g. instead of adding A before B, add B's labels after A, then switch the
data back).
.page
Examples:

LABEL-CONCAT (file_1,file_2)

would add all history and property sets from file_1 to the end of the
history and property sections of file_2.

LABEL-CONCAT (file_1,file_2) property="CAMERA_MODEL"

would transfer the CAMERA_MODEL property (instance 1) to file_2.

LABEL-CONCAT (file_1,file_2) outfile task="GEN" instance=1

would add history task GEN, instance 1, from file_1 to file_2's labels,
writing the result in outfile.  file_2 is not modified.
.VAR INP -CONCAT
INP specifies the name of the two input files.  The result has the data
and complete label of input 2, with selected label sets from input 1.

Note:  if no output file name is given, input 2's label will be modified
directly.
.VAR OUT -CONCAT
OUT is the name of the output file to which the data and the modified
label are to be written.

If OUT is omitted from the command line, the label sets are added to
input 2 directly.
.VAR TYPE -CONCAT
TYPE specifies the type of label to transfer.

BOTH: The entire label, both history and property, is transferred, if
    TASK and PROPERTY are omitted.  If either TASK or PROPERTY is specified,
    only that given single set is transferred, and TYPE=BOTH is quietly
    ignored.  BOTH is the default.
HISTORY: The history label is transferred.  If TASK is given, only one
    history task is transferred, otherwise the entire history label is.
    If TASK is specified, TYPE may be defaulted; you don't have to set both.
PROPERTY: The property label is transferred.  If PROPERTY is given, only one
    property set is transferred, otherwise the entire property label is.
    If PROPERTY is specified, TYPE may be defaulted; you don't have to set
    both.
.VAR TASK -CONCAT
TASK specifies the name of the history task to transfer.  If neither TASK
nor PROPERTY is given, the entire history or property label is transferred
(according to TYPE).

TASK and PROPERTY may not both be specified.
.VAR PROPERTY -CONCAT
PROPERTY specifies the name of the history task to transfer.  If neither
PROPERTY nor TASK is given, the entire history or property label is
transferred (according to TYPE).

TASK and PROPERTY may not both be specified.
.VAR INSTANCE -CONCAT
INSTANCE specifies the instance number of the history task or property set
to transfer (relative to input 1).  It is only used if TASK or PROPERTY is
active.

The default is 1.

!=======================================================================
!
.SUBCMD CREATE
LABEL-CREATE takes a file with no label and, using the
information given by the user, generates a system label for it.

VICAR in some cases can attempt to determining the image size
for you on a VMS machine if you don't specify it, but to avoid
potential problems it is recommended that you give the input size
with NL, NS, and NB when it is known.  The image size cannot be
automatically determined on a Unix machine.

In addition, if the pixel format is not specified, byte format
is assumed.  If the file organization is not specified, BSQ
(band sequential) is assumed.

Unless you specify otherwise via the HOST label, the input file
is assumed to be in the data format of the machine you are running
on.  If this is not the case (i.e. the file was created on a VAX
and you are running on a Sun), then you need to specify HOST.
.VAR INP -CREATE
The name of a single input file which does not have a valid 
VICAR label.  The input is assumed unconditionally to have
no label, and the new label is simply prepended to the output.
.VAR OUT -CREATE
The name of a single output file to receive the new label and
the data from the input.
.VAR NL -CREATE
The number of lines in the input image.  Note that this number is not
a window but the actual number of image lines (not including any
binary headers), and is unconditionally assumed to be correct.
.VAR NS -CREATE
The number of samples in the input image.  Note that this number is
not a window but the actual number of samples (not including any
binary headers), and is unconditionally assumed to be correct.
.VAR NB -CREATE
The number of bands in the input image.  Note that this number is not
a window but the actual number of bands (not including any binary
headers), and is unconditionally assumed to be correct.
Default is a one band image.
.VAR NBB -CREATE
The number of bytes of binary prefix which precede each image
record in the output file.  This number is added to NS (for BSQ or
BIL files) or NB (for BIP files) to get the total size of an
image record (i.e. the values for NS and NB should not include NBB).

The BINARY keyword must be specified in order for NBB to take effect.
The default for NBB is 0.
.VAR NLB -CREATE
The number of lines of binary header that precede the image data.
This number is added to the number of image records to get the total
number of record in the image (i.e. the values for NL, NS, and NB should
not include NLB).

The BINARY keyword must be specified in order for NLB to take effect.
The default for NLB is 0.
.VAR FORMAT -CREATE
The format of the pixels in the file.  Defaults to 
BYTE.  The valid values are:

	BYTE	Single byte unsigned binary integer
	HALF	Half-precision (usually two bytes) signed integer
	FULL	Full-precision (usually four bytes) signed integer
	REAL 	Single-precision floating point number
	DOUB	Double-precision floating point number
	COMP	Complex pairs of REAL numbers in the order (real,imaginary)
.VAR ORG -CREATE
ORG provides a means of specifying the file organization.  Organizations
may be : BSQ (band sequential), BIP (band interleaved by pixel), or BIL
(band inerleaved by line). Default is BSQ.
.VAR BINARY -CREATE
If BINARY is specified as a keyword, the new file is created with a binary
label specified by NLB and NBB.  The data in the binary labels comes from
the input file, i.e. if NLB is 2 then the first two lines of the input file
will make up the binary header.  See also NLB and NBB.
.VAR WINDOW -CREATE
WINDOW provides a means of extracting a subset of the input
for writing to the output.  Its format is the same as that 
of the VICAR size field,

	WINDOW = (sl,ss,nl,ns)

where 		sl	is the starting line to read,
		ss	is the starting sample,
		nl	is the number of lines to read,
		ns	is the number of samples to be
			extracted from each line.

Note that the window is independent of the parameters NL and NS.
NL and NS specify the physical size of the input, and window 
provides a subset of the input for output.  To create a 3-dimensional
window, the BANDS parameter must also be used.

If BINARY is set, then WINDOW and BANDS are ignored.
.VAR BANDS -CREATE
BANDS provides a means of extracting a subset of the input
for writing to the output.  Its format is as follows:

	BANDS = (sb,nb)

where 		sb	is the starting band to read,
		nb	is the number of bands to be
			extracted.

Note that the BANDS parameter is independent of the NB parameter.
NB specifies the physical size of the input, and BANDS
provides a subset of the input for output.  See also WINDOW.

If BINARY is set, then WINDOW and BANDS are ignored.
.VAR COMMENT -CREATE
COMMENT is an optional string label item for the user to insert
into the label.  It is stored under the keyword COMMENT in
the current task.  It may be up to 132 characters in length.
.VAR HOST -CREATE
HOST provides a means to specify the type of machine the data came from.
If the image was created on a machine type other than the one you are
running on, then the image data will likely be in a different data format,
e.g. VAX floating point instead of IEEE floating point.  Setting the proper
value for HOST allows other VICAR programs to access the image data
properly.

The default for HOST is "NATIVE", meaning the data format for the machine
that LABEL-CREATE is running on.

.VAR INTFMT -CREATE
INTFMT specifies the format used to represent integers in the image.
It should rarely be used, as it defaults to the integer format for the
machine specified in HOST.

The valid values may expand as VICAR is ported to other machines, but as
of this writing they are:

   NATIVE    The format for the machine LABEL-CREATE is currently running on.
   LOCAL     Same as NATIVE.
   HIGH      High byte first, "big endian", used with most hosts.
   LOW       Low byte first, "little endian", used with VAX-VMS, DECSTATN,
             and all AXP and X86 machines.
.VAR REALFMT -CREATE
REALFMT specifies the format used to represent floating-point data in the
image.  It should rarely be used, as it defaults to the floating-point
format for the machine specified in HOST.

The valid values may expand as VICAR is ported to other machines, but as
of this writing they are:

   NATIVE    The format for the machine LABEL-CREATE is currently running on.
   LOCAL     Same as NATIVE.
   IEEE      IEEE 754 format, with high-order bytes firt, used with most hosts.
   RIEEE     Reverse IEEE format, like IEEE but with bytes reversed.  Used
             on DECSTATN, all X86, and all AXP except AXP-VMS.
   VAX       VAX format, single precision is VAX F, double is VAX D, used on
             VAX-VMS and AXP-VMS.
.VAR BHOST -CREATE
BHOST provides a means to specify the type of machine the data in the
binary label came from.  If the binary label was created on a machine
type other than the one you are running on, then the binary label data
will likely be in a different data format, e.g. VAX floating point instead
of IEEE floating point.  Setting the proper value for BHOST allows other
VICAR programs to access the image data properly.

BHOST defaults to the value given for HOST (which in turn defaults to the
native format), so BHOST should rarely be needed.  BHOST is ignored if
BINARY is not set.

.VAR BINTFMT -CREATE
BINTFMT specifies the format used to represent integers in the image.
It should rarely be used, as it defaults to the integer format for the
machine specified in BHOST.  BINTFMT is ignored if BINARY is not set.

The valid values may expand as VICAR is ported to other machines, but as
of this writing they are:

   NATIVE    The format for the machine LABEL-CREATE is currently running on.
   LOCAL     Same as NATIVE.
   HIGH      High byte first, "big endian", used with most hosts.
   LOW       Low byte first, "little endian", used with VAX-VMS, DECSTATN,
             and all AXP and X86 machines.
.VAR BREALFMT -CREATE
BREALFMT specifies the format used to represent floating-point data in the
image.  It should rarely be used, as it defaults to the floating-point
format for the machine specified in BHOST.  BREALFMT is ignored if BINARY
is not set.

The valid values may expand as VICAR is ported to other machines, but as
of this writing they are:

   NATIVE    The format for the machine LABEL-CREATE is currently running on.
   LOCAL     Same as NATIVE.
   IEEE      IEEE 754 format, with high-order bytes firt, used with most hosts.
   RIEEE     Reverse IEEE format, like IEEE but with bytes reversed.  Used
             on DECSTATN, all X86, and all AXP except AXP-VMS.
   VAX       VAX format, single precision is VAX F, double is VAX D, used on
             VAX-VMS and AXP-VMS.
.VAR BLTYPE -CREATE
BLTYPE is a string specifying the type of the binary label, if present.
It is optional, but is highly recommended to document what kind of binary
label is present.  No checking is performed on the value for BLTYPE, but
it should correspond to one of the registered binary label type names.
Consult the cognizant programmer for the program that created the image if
you do not know the binary label type name.

.SUBCMD DELETE
LABEL-DELETE can be used to delete all or part of the history or
property label information in a given VICAR image file.  The extent
of deletion is controlled by the different parameters.  For help
on the operation of each parameter, type HELP parameter-name
from tutor mode.

If only an input file is given, the input file label is modified,
and no output is produced.  If an output file is given, then
the input file is not modified and the output file is copied 
from the input.

NOTE:  The addition of Property instances is backwards compatible except
for LABEL-DELETE.  If INSTNCES is not specified, LABEL-DELETE will
operate on *all* instances of the given properties (just like it works
with history/tasks), rather than just the first property (which would
be the backwards-compatible way).
.PAGE
Examples:

LABEL-DELETE A B

The entire history label is deleted from A, and the result
is written to B.  Only the system and property labels remain.

LABEL-DELETE A 'PROPERTY

The entire property label is deleted from A.  The system and
history labels remain.

LABEL-DELETE A KEYS=COMMENT

Every occurrence of the item COMMENT is deleted from the history label
of A, leaving the rest of the label intact.  No output file is produced.
.page
Examples (cont.)

LABEL-DELETE A KEYS=/ALL 'HISTORY

Every keyword is deleted from each history task, leaving the history
subsets themselves intact. 

LABEL-DELETE A B TASKS=(GEOMA,LABEL)

Deletes every occurence of the history subsets created
by the tasks GEOMA and LABEL (including the current task).

LABEL-DELETE A B PROPERTY=MAP

Deletes the entire MAP property (all instances), including the property header.

LABEL-DELETE A B PROPERTY=MAP INSTNCES=1

Deletes the entire MAP property (first instance only), including the
property header.
.page
Examples (cont.)

LABEL-DELETE A B KEYS=(NAH,COMMENT) TASKS=(LABEL,GEOMA) INSTNCES=(1,2)

Here let's assume that GEOMA was run on A once, and it wrote the
item NAH.  LABEL was run on the image twice previously (making 
the current task instance 3), writing the keyword COMMENT only
once.  The item NAH will then be deleted from the first (only)
instance of GEOMA, and COMMENT will be deleted from the one
instance of LABEL in which it is found.

LABEL-DELETE A B KEYS=MANYVAL ELEMENT=3 NELEMENT=2

Elements 3 and 4 will be deleted from all occurrences of the
item MANYVAL in the history label.  If any occurrence of MANYVAL
has 2 or less elements, nothing will be changed for that occurrence.
If any occurrence of MANYVAL has 3 elements, only the third will
be deleted.
.page
Examples (cont.)

LABEL-DELETE A B KEYS=YOW TASK=FUNSTUF INSTNCES=2 ELEMENT=5 NELEMENT=1

Element 5 will be deleted from the item YOW found in the
second instance of the task FUNSTUF.

LABEL-DELETE A B KEYS=COORD PROPERTY=MINE ELEMENT=2 NELEMENT=2

Elements 2 and 3 will be deleted from the item COORD found in the
property subset MINE.

LABEL-DELETE A B KEYS=/ALL ELEMENT=2 NELEMENT=-1

Elements 2 through the end of the item will be deleted for every
item in the history label.  The result will be that all history label
items in the file become single-valued.
!
.VAR INP -DELETE
Name of a single input file.  It must have a valid VICAR label.

If no output file is given, the input file label is modified.
.VAR OUT -DELETE
Name of an optional output file.  If an output file name is 
given, the modified label and the image data are copied to the
output file, and the input file remains unchanged.

If no output file name is given, the input file label is
modified directly.
.VAR KEYS -DELETE
Indicates the names, or keywords, of specific items to be deleted.
If nothing is given under TASKS or PROPERTY, then every occurrence
of the given keywords will be deleted from the appropriate (history
or property) label section.  A list of specific subsets can be given
with the TASKS or PROPERTY and INSTNCES parameters to narrow the
scope of the deletion.  ELEMENT and NELEMENT may also be used to
limit what is deleted.

In addition, the value /ALL may be given for this parameter,
specifying that every key is to be deleted provided it does not
form part of a subset header.  The effect is to empty the subset
without deleting the subset itself.
.VAR TASKS -DELETE
TASKS can be used to limit the deletion process to certain
history subsets or task labels within the history label.

If items were given under the parameter KEYS, then the task
names given limit the deletion of those items to the named tasks.
Otherwise, the subsets named by TASKS are deleted.

The parameter INSTNCES can be used to limit which tasks are looked in
for items (if KEYS is given) or which tasks are deleted (if KEYS not given).

The presence of TASKS implies that the history label will be modified,
so TYPE is unnecessary.  If you wish to delete a property label, use
PROPERTY instead.  If neither TASKS nor PROPERTY are given, and TYPE is
omitted, then the HISTORY label is assumed.

An error occurs if both TASKS and PROPERTY are given, or if TASKS is
given with TYPE=PROPERTY.
.VAR INSTNCES -DELETE
The parameter INSTNCES can be used to limit the history tasks or property
sets in which items are deleted (if KEYS is given), or the tasks or
properties which are deleted (if KEYS is not given).

If specific task/property names were given in TASKS/PROPERTY, then each
value given for INSTNCES will be applied to every subset task name.  If
nothing was specified in TASKS/PROPERTY (and TYPE is set), then every task
or property with the named instances will be deleted.

 For example, TASKS=(STRETCH,LGEOM) INSTNCES=(1,4)

would refer to the first and fourth instances of both the STRETCH
task and the LGEOM task.  If one or more of the tasks/properties does not
exist, an informational message is issued, but no fatal error occurs.

.VAR PROPERTY -DELETE
PROPERTY can be used to limit the deletion process to certain
property subsets within the property label.

If items were given under the parameter KEYS, then the property
names given limit the deletion of those items to the named property.
Otherwise, the subsets named by PROPERTY are deleted.

The parameter INSTNCES can be used to limit which properties are looked
in for items (if KEYS is given) or which properties are deleted (if KEYS
not given).

The presence of PROPERTY implies that the property label will be modified,
so TYPE is unnecessary.  If you wish to delete a history label, use
TASKS instead, or specify TYPE=HISTORY.  If neither TASKS nor PROPERTY
are given, and TYPE is omitted, then the HISTORY label is assumed.

An error occurs if both TASKS and PROPERTY are given, or if PROPERTY is
given with TYPE=HISTORY.

NOTE:  The addition of Property instances is backwards compatible except
for LABEL-DELETE.  If INSTNCES is not specified, LABEL-DELETE will
operate on *all* instances of the given properties (just like it works
with history/tasks), rather than just the first property (which would
be the backwards-compatible way).
.VAR ELEMENT -DELETE
Specifies the starting element to delete in each item for multi-valued
label items.  This parameter limits the action of the other parameters.
Without ELEMENT, each selected item is deleted in its entirety.  With
ELEMENT, only part of each selected item is normally deleted.

If the element specified does not exist in a particular item, then
no action is taken on that item, and no warning is issued.

If ELEMENT is given as 1 (the default value), then the entire
item may be deleted, depending on the value of NELEMENT.

This parameter is normally used in conjunction with NELEMENT.
.VAR NELEMENT -DELETE
Specifies the number of elements to delete in each item for multi-valued
label items.  This parameter limits the action of the other parameters.
NELEMENT defaults to -1.

If NELEMENT is given as -1 (or defaulted), then all the remaining
elements in the item are deleted.  If ELEMENT is greater than 1, it
deletes all elements from ELEMENT to the end of the item.  If ELEMENT
is 1, the entire item is deleted.

If there are not enough elements in a particular item to satisfy
the request, then the number of elements deleted is reduced to fit.
No warning is issued.  For example, if an item has 5 elements, and you
request ELEMENT 4, NELEMENT 3, that would mean you want to delete
elements 4, 5, and 6.  Since there are only 5 elements, only 4 and 5
are deleted.

This parameter is normally used in conjunction with ELEMENT.
.VAR TYPE -DELETE
Specifies whether the items will be deleted from the HISTORY or PROPERTY
label.  If TYPE is not specified, the type is assumed from the presence
of the TASKS or PROPERTY parameters.  If neither TASKS, PROPERTY, or
TYPE is specified, then HISTORY labels are assumed.

If both the TASKS and PROPERTY labels are specified, or if they disagree
with a given TYPE, then an error occurs.
!
!=======================================================================
!
.SUBCMD LIST
LABEL-LIST is used to list out the contents of the label in 
various formats (specified by EXTENT).  Up to 10 input
files may be given.  No processing is done on any of the
files.

Multi-valued items are listed enclosed in parentheses and
separated by commas.
.VAR INP -LIST
The names of from one to ten input files.  The input files
must have valid labels.
.VAR EXTENT -LIST
EXTENT specifies how and how much of the label is 
to be listed.  The valid values are:

      ALL       SYSTEM, PROPERTY, and HISTORY together.
      SYSTEM    Lists out the important system label information
                in a readable format.
      PROPERTY  Lists out a header for each property subset,
                followed by all keyword-value pairs in that subset.
      TASKS     Lists out a header for each history subset task,
                containing the task name, name of the user who ran the
                task, and the date and time of the task.
      HISTORY   Lists out a header for each history subset task,
                followed by all keyword-value pairs in that subset.
      DUMP      Lists out every keyword-value pair in the label.
                No attempt is made to format beyond the most basic level.
.VAR PACK -LIST
PACK specifies whether or not to pack more than one label item onto
one line in the output.  Valid values are PACK and NOPACK.  NOPACK
is the default.

If NOPACK is in effect, every label item is listed on a line by
itself.  If there is more than one element in an item, as many
elements as will fit are listed on the same line.

If PACK is in effect, then label items are packed together as much
as possible on the output line, separated by spaces.  If there is
not room for the label key and at least one of the values, a new
line is started.  Only label items from one property or history
subset are packed together.

PACK and NOPACK apply when EXTENT is PROPERTY, HISTORY, or DUMP.
It also applies when EXTENT is ALL, but only to the property and
history portions.
.VAR NOUSRTIM
 This parameter has one valid keyword value: NOUSRTIM.
 
 If NOUSRTIM is specified, then the username and datetime that is
 normally displayed from the label is suppressed.  This allows 
 comparison of regression test logs without the need to filter out the
 username and datetime, which change from run to run.

 The default behavior (if NOUSRTIM is not given) is to include the
 username and datetime from the label in the listing.
!
!=======================================================================
!
.SUBCMD REMOVE
LABEL-REMOVE can be used to remove the the VICAR label, binary header,
binary prefix, or all three (the default) from the input, and write the
results with the data in an output file. If the output is a tape, the
NOBLOCK keyword may be specified to prevent the tape from being blocked
(useful for sending to external sites).
.VAR INP -REMOVE
VICAR labeled input file whose label is to be removed.  The input
file data will be copied to the output, and the input file will
remain unchanged.
.VAR OUT -REMOVE
The required output file.  By default, the output file will consist only
of image data and will have no label (but see the BINARY parameter).

Take care to record the image size of the output file, since VICAR
may not be able to determine the proper size if needed on a future
date.
.VAR SIZE -REMOVE
SIZE can be used to copy only a portion of the input to the output
file.  It is in standard VICAR size field format

	SIZE=(sl,ss,nl,ns)	,

where 		sl	is the starting line to read,
		ss	is the starting sample,
		nl	is the number of lines to read,
		ns	is the number of samples to be
			extracted from each line.

Note that SIZE works only in the line and sample directions--to provide
a complete subsection specification, you must also use the BANDS parameter.

SIZE is ignored if BINARY is set.
.VAR BANDS -REMOVE
BANDS can be used to copy only a portion of the input to the output
file.  It has the following format:

	BANDS= (sb,nb)

where 		sb	is the starting band to read,
		nb	is the number of bands to read.

The output file size will be nl x ns x nb, where nl and ns are
specified with the SIZE parameter.

BANDS is ignored if BINARY is in effect.
.VAR BLOCKING -REMOVE
If NOBLOCK is specified, then if the output is tape the tape will
not be blocked, that is, there will be one record per block on the
tape.  If NOBLOCK is not specified, then the output tape will be in
blocks of in the neighborhood of 20,000 bytes.

If the output is disk, this parameter has no effect.
.VAR BINARY -REMOVE
This keyword controls whether to include binary headers and/or prefixes
in the output.  Note that the NOBINHEAD and NOBINPREF options RETAIN THE
VICAR LABEL!

BINARY causes LABEL-REMOVE to remove only the VICAR label; the binary
header and prefix are both retained.
 
NOBINARY causes LABEL-REMOVE to remove the binary label (both header and
prefix) along with the VICAR label.

NOBINHEAD causes LABEL-REMOVE to remove only the binary header.  The
VICAR label is retained.

NOBINPREF causes LABEL-REMOVE to remove only the binary prefix of
image lines.  The VICAR label is retained.

The default is NOBINARY.

If anything other than NOBINARY is specified, then the SIZE and BANDS
parameters are disabled, so the entire file will be copied.
!
!=======================================================================
!
.SUBCMD REPLACE
LABEL-REPLACE is used in the same fashion as LABEL-ADD, except

1)  The item must already exist, and
2)  The item may be in the system label as well as the history and
    property labels.

If TASK is specified, TYPE=HISTORY is assumed and an error occurs if
TYPE is different.  Likewise, if PROPERTY is specified, TYPE=PROPERTY
is assumed.

To replace an item in the system label, the keyword SYSTEM must be
given, and TASK and PROPERTY may not be specified.  Great care should
be given to replacing any system items, however, as it may affect how
the data is read by the executive.  In particular, NS, RECSIZE, BUFSIZE,
and LBLSIZE should never be changed.  The results would be unpredictable.
.VAR INP -REPLACE
INP specifies the name of the input file.  The input must have a valid
VICAR label.

Note:  If no output file name is given, the input file's label will 
be modified directly.
.VAR OUT -REPLACE
OUT is the name of the output file to which the data and the modified
label are to be written.

If OUT is omitted from the command line, the label items are replaced
in the input file directly.
.VAR ITEMS -REPLACE
The label items which are to be replaced. The items are given as a
list in a single string parameter, in the form

key(element)=value-list

where "key" is a valid (0 - 8 character) label keyword, "element"
is an optional starting element number (an integer), and "value-list"
is the list of values to be associated with that keyword.

The operation differs slightly depending on whether or not the
starting element number is given.

If the element is not given, i.e. the item is of the form "key=value-list",
then the entire label item is replaced.  The indicated keyword is
first deleted from the label in its entirety, then the new item is
added with values specified in "value-list".  The keyword must
previously exist in the label, or an error message will be issued.
.page
If the element is given, then only parts of the label item are
affected.  If the keyword currently exists in the file, then the
indicated values replace existing elements in it, starting at element
number "element".  For instance, if the label item "LIST" had four
values (1,2,3,4), and the following was in the label-replace ITEM
string: "LIST(2)=(10,11)", then values 10 and 11 would be put into
LIST starting at position 2, replacing the old values at those
positions.  The new value of LIST would be (1,10,11,4).

If the element is given, but the keyword does not currently exist
in the file, the element number is ignored and a new label item
is created containing the values in "value-list".  This is slightly
different from the action when "element" is not given, as the item
does not have to previously exist.
.page
A value of -1 for the element number indicates the end of the label
item, i.e. all elements will be appended to the end of the item.

If the same keyword appears twice in "value-list", each is treated
independently, i.e. the first one is used, then the second one.  If
the first one causes the number of elements or the relative position
of an element to change, the second one uses the NEW positions, values,
and number of elements.
.page
"Value-list" is a list of values, enclosed in parentheses, and
separated by commas.  If there is only one value, the parentheses
are not necessary.

All of the values in "value-list" should be of the same type:
integer, real, doub(le) or string.  The type should also match the type
of the existing label, if "element" is given.  The LABEL program will
try to convert to the appropriate type, but if it can't it will give
an error.  It can convert integers to real, doub(le) or string, and 
reals to doub(le) or string.  Any other conversion is an error.

The four types are differentiated by the way in which they are
specified. Strings should be contained in single quotes.  The quotes
are not strictly necessary if there are no commas, spaces, or parentheses
in the string, but they should normally be included anyway.  Standard
FORTRAN notation for integers and reals is understood. Doub(le)s
are real values with more than 6 significant digits.              

.PAGE
Examples of valid "value-list" specifications:

Specification			Meaning
-------------			-------
787				single integer
(21)				single integer
(6,-9,42)			list of three integers
+3e2				single real
-2.000001			single doub(le)
(3.14159, 2)			list of two reals.  The integer 2 is
				  converted to a real: (3.14159, 2.0)
'a string item'			single string
('another string item')		single string
('string 1','string 2')		list of two strings
('string 1', 123, 4.5, wow)	list of four strings.  The values get converted
				  to strings: ('string 1', '123', '4.5', 'wow')
.page
Using this input format, the entire list of items is input
as a single string, such as

"slope=-45.8, planet='Jupiter' avgdn = 128 coord=(86.3, 44.8)"

This string replaces the real value "slope", the string value
"planet", the integer value "avgdn", and the two element real
value "coord".

.VARI TASK -REPLACE
The name of the task heading or history subset under which the label
item is to be stored.

The presence of TASK implies that the history label will be modified,
so TYPE is unnecessary.  If you wish to replace a property label, use
PROPERTY instead.  If neither TASK nor PROPERTY are given, and TYPE is
omitted, all labels will be placed in the history label under the
heading of the current task (LABEL if an output file is given, the
last task otherwise).

An error occurs if both TASK and PROPERTY are given, or if TASK is
given with TYPE=PROPERTY or TYPE=SYSTEM.
.VAR INSTANCE -REPLACE
Since the same program may be run on an image several times, it is
possible to have multiple history task headings with the same name.
Property sets may also have more than one instance (e.g. different
versions of a camera model).  INSTANCE=n is used to refer to the
n-th occurence of the named history task or property set.  If INSTANCE
is not specified, 1 is assumed.

If TASK or PROPERTY is not specified, then INSTANCE is ignored.
.VAR PROPERTY -REPLACE
The name of the property subset under which the label item is to be
stored.

The presence of PROPERTY implies that the property label will be
modified, so TYPE is unnecessary.  If you wish to replace a history
label, use TASK instead.  PROPERTY is mandatory for property labels,
so even if you say TYPE=PROPERTY you must still specify a property name.

An error occurs if both PROPERTY and TASK are given, or if PROPERTY is
given with TYPE=HISTORY or TYPE=SYSTEM.
.VARI TYPE -REPLACE
TASK specifies whether the items will be replaced in the SYSTEM,
HISTORY, or PROPERTY label.  TYPE is not normally needed for history
and property labels, since the presence of the TASK parameter implies
history labels, while the presence of the PROPERTY parameter implies
property labels.  TYPE may be used for error-checking, however, as
TASK, PROPERTY, and TYPE must all agree on the type of labels being added.

To replace an item in the system label, the keyword SYSTEM must be given.
Great care should be given to replacing any system items, however, as 
it may affect how the data is read be the executive.  In particular,
NS, RECSIZE, BUFSIZE, and LBLSIZE should never be changed.  The results
would be unpredictable.  If TYPE=SYSTEM is given, then TASK and PROPERTY
may not be used.
