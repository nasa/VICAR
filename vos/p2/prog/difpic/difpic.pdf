DIFPIC version 06Oct11
.HELP
 PURPOSE:

Program DIFPIC is used to find the difference between two images.  By default
DIFPIC only diff the pixels. There are optional arguments to diff VICAR
property labels, binary headers, and line prefix as well.

 EXECUTION:

The input images may have any VICAR data format: BYTE, HALF, FULL, REAL, DOUB,
or COMP.  Both input images must have the same format.  The data format is taken
from the VICAR label of the first input file.  The optional output 
image has the same data format as the input images.  

Both input images must have the same dimensions, or, if they are of different 
sizes, the SIZE parameter must be specified.  If the images are three-dimensional,
they must be of BSQ or BIL file organization;  BIP files are not supported.
.PAGE
When an output file is produced, the output DN (data number) for a given line and 
sample is found by subtracting the DN from the second image from the DN from the 
first image. The resulting data numbers are then checked for being valid for the 
data type (byte, halfword, or fullword) of the image and are adjusted if invalid.  
For byte data, data numbers less than 0 are set to 0 (or are added to 256 if MOD 
is specified), and data numbers greater than 255 are set to 255. 
For halfword data, data numbers less than -32768 are set to -32768, and data numbers 
greater than 32767 are set to 32767. 
For fullword data, data numbers less than -2147483648 are set to -2147483648, and 
data numbers greater than 2147483647 are set to 2147483647. 
For formats REAL, DOUB, and COMP, no checking for floating point overflow or 
underflow is performed by the program.  Thus it is possible for DIFPIC to terminate 
with such a floating point error.  If this happens, the user can either run DIFPIC 
without on output file or divide both input images through by 1.0E5 and run DIFPIC 
on the results.
NOTE that program F2 can also be used to compare images, with somewhat greater
generality and robustness, but that program is not as simple to use and does not
give as much supplementary information as does DIFPIC.
.PAGE
When compare VICAR property labels, the program can optionally ignore specified
properties.
To compare binary headers and line prefixes, the program looks for FMT mapping
file to map a BLTYPE to an FMT file for line prefix or binary header. Using
the FMT file, the program finds a list of fields, which are OBJECTs in the FMT 
file, to be diff-ed for.

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT
      The following command line formats show the major allowable forms:
      difpic INP=(a1,a2) OUT=b SIZE=(sl,ss,nl,ns) optional parameters
      difpic INP=(a1,a2) OUT=b  SL=sl SS=ss NL=nl NS=ns optional parameters
      difpic (a1,a2) b (sl,ss,nl,ns) optional parameters
      difpic (a1,a2) b optional parameters
      difpic INP=(a1,a2) SIZE=(sl,ss,nl,ns) optional parameters
      difpic INP=(a1,a2) SL=sl SS=ss NL=nl NS=ns optional parameters
      difpic (a1,a2) (sl,ss,nl,ns) optional parameters
      difpic (a1,a2) optional parameters
      difpic INP=(a1,a2) bincmp=bincmp lprcmp=lprcmp verbose=verbose
      difpic INP=(a1,a2) lblcmp=lblcmp ignore_lbls="PRODUCT_CREATION_TIME" verbose=verbose

       Here 'a1' and 'a2' represent the input image file names, and
       'b' represents the output image file name.
.PAGE
EXAMPLES

1.    difpic INP=(A1,A2) OUT=B 'MOD 

      In this example the difference between the byte images A1 and A2 is
      written to the output file B.  Where the DN for image A1 is greater
      than the DN for image A2, the arithmetic difference is less than 0.
      The output DN is determined by taking the arithmetic difference modulo
      256.

2.    difpic INP=(A1,A2) 

      In this example the number of differences (pixels) between the 
      images A1 and A2 is printed and no output file is produced.
.PAGE
STATISTICS
Statistics on the number of differences are displayed by default.  Fuller 
statistics are produced if an output file is specified.  

Some of the statistics are average values for the differences found by DIFPIC.
These are computed in floating point and may involve numerous additions and 
thus may result in slightly different values on different computers.

The value displayed for AVE VAL OF DIFFS includes all pixels: those with 
positive, negative or zero differences.  This is a floating point value based 
on the real differences between the pixels and not on the value of the output 
pixel, which might be coerced to the numeric limits for the data type of the 
pixel.
.PAGE
 PRECISION: 
  When an output file is specified, DIFPIC computes the average difference
as well as the average positive and negative differences.  These are computed
in a straightforward way, adding up the differences and then dividing by the
number of differences.  (These computations are intended to be fast but not
necessarily highly precise.)  To accommodate the large differences that are
possible in the worst cases, the adding up takes place in single precision
floating point for all data formats except for BYTE and DOUBLE.  If there are a
large number of differences, this can result in a large number of floating
point operations and in some cases can result in a noticeable amount of
round-off error.  The test procedure contains such a case.  Thus the precision
of the average differences is not guaranteed.  In normal use the variation in 
these values that can be expected on different MIPS-supported machines should
not differ by more than 1 in six significant digits.  In contrast, the NUMBER
OF DIFFERENCES is a precise integer value.
.PAGE
RESTRICTIONS
1. The input files must both have the same data format. 
2. The maximum number of bytes per line is 200000.
3. BIP file organization is not supported.

 COGNIZANT PROGRAMMER:   Lucas Kamp

 REVISIONS:
    12-91  SP   PORTED TO RUN ON BOTH UNIX AND VMS.
     9-92  SP   Made buffer size 200000 bytes. Modified to handle 
                all data formats.  CHANGED AVE VALS TO DISPLAY AS FLOAT.
                CORRECTED "AVE DN OF PIX" TO "AVE VAL OF DIFFS"
     3-93  SP   Modified to not use -2147483648 to work around Sun compiler.
                Added ability to handle 3D files if SIZE field defaulted
                and no output file specified.
     7-94  SP   Allowed format="WORD" as alternative to HALF.
     8-03  lwk  removed restrictions on NB, added SB parameter
    11-03  lwk  added checks on size/format of input files
    09-11  rrp  converted difpic to be a regular subroutine and not
                a VICAR main44 subroutine. Modified the subroutine
		to accept open input file unit numbers (instead of
		opening the input files in the subroutine) and a return
		status to indicate 0 if no differences are found or
		1 if there are differences. Modiffed DPFPIC* subroutines
		to return a status value as indicated above. Added new
		parameters to this pdf for controlling the comparison of
		labels, binary header, line prefix, for ignoring
		label items and binary header fields, and the name of the
		binary header fmt file and line prefix fmt files.

in the input images are to be 
compared.
.VARIABLE LPFMTFILES

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE OUT
If no output file is specified, DIFPIC operates in a faster mode and only
prints the number of different pixels.
.VARIABLE RETVAL
The value of RETVAL will be the sum of all comparisons (label, history
label, binary header, line prefix, and pixel). 
Individually, if a comparison finds no difference, its return value is
0. Otherwise, it's 1 for property label, 2 for binary header, 4 for
history label, 8 for line prefix, and 16 for pixel.
.VARIABLE SIZE
Standard Vicar size field:
  (SL,SS,NL,NS)
You can enter SL,SS,NL,
and NS together as SIZE, OR
enter the SL,SS,NL, and NS
parameters separately.
By default, the entire input
image is used if these
parameters are not entered.
.VARIABLE BANDS
Standard Vicar Bands field:
  (SB,NB)
You can enter SB and NB together
as BANDS, OR enter the SB and NB
parameters separately.
By default, the entire input
image is used if these
.VARIABLE NB
Number of bands: This may be used for multi-band (3D) images.  The default is
the number of bands in the input image label.
.VARIABLE MOD
MOD is an option for byte images that is useful when one wants to see in the 
output file the location of all pixels for which the input DNs are not the 
same.  When MOD is specified for byte images, all pixels with the same input
DNs will have an output DN of 0, and all pixels that do not have the same input
DNs will have an output DN that is not 0.  MOD has no effect except for BYTE 
images.  MOD is recommended for byte images when an output file is produced.

For byte data if the difference computed is less than 0, the output DN is set
to 0 if MOD is not specified, but is set to 256 plus the difference if MOD is
specified.  This amounts to taking the difference modulo 256.
.VARIABLE VERBOSE
Specify if the label diff, binary header diff and line prefix diff should print
the differences found to console (VERBOSE) or not (SILENT).
.VARIABLE LBL_IGNORE
List labels that should be ignored when comparing images. Ignored labels are
treated as if they are don't exists in the image and thus ignored labels with
different values or missing in one image are not considered when determining
if the labels between the given images differ.
.VARIABLE  HSTCMP
Currently, this option is unimplemented, and always return false (different).
.VARIABLE PROP_IGNORE
List properties that shoule be ignored when comparing images. All labels from
these properties are ignored and the images are considered same if all the
labels under the remaining properties are same.
.VARIABLE BHFMTMAP
Mapping of BLTYPE keyword to update-to-date version of binary header FMT
file for every project.
.VARIABLE LPFMTMAP
Mapping of BLTYPE keyword to update-to-date version of line prefix FMT file
for every project.
.VARIABLE LPK_IGNORE
List of line prefix fields to ignore. The name of a field appears in dot
notation. For example, if you have column named 'A', and another column
named 'B' inside 'A', to refer to 'B', you use 'A.B'. If there are more
than one column that can be referred to by the same name, then all of
those columns are ignored.
.VARIABLE BHK_IGNORE
List of binary header fields to ignore. The name of a field appears in dot
notation. For example, if you have column named 'A', and another column
named 'B' inside 'A', to refer to 'B', you use 'A.B'. If there are more
than one column that can be referred to by the same name, then all of
those columns are ignored.
