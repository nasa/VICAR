$! Build proc for MIPL module timssubs
$! VPACK Version 1.8, Friday, March 20, 1998, 02:51:03
$!
$! Execute by entering:		$ @timssubs
$!
$! The primary option controls how much is to be built.  It must be in
$! the first parameter.  Only the capitalized letters below are necessary.
$!
$! Primary options are:
$!   COMPile     Compile the program modules
$!   ALL         Build a private version, and unpack the PDF and DOC files.
$!   STD         Build a private version, and unpack the PDF file(s).
$!   SYStem      Build the system version with the CLEAN option, and
$!               unpack the PDF and DOC files.
$!   CLEAN       Clean (delete/purge) parts of the code, see secondary options
$!   UNPACK      All files are created.
$!   REPACK      Only the repack file is created.
$!   SOURCE      Only the source files are created.
$!   SORC        Only the source files are created.
$!               (This parameter is left in for backward compatibility).
$!   IMAKE       Only the IMAKE file (used with the VIMAKE program) is created.
$!
$!   The default is to use the STD parameter if none is provided.
$!
$!****************************************************************************
$!
$! The secondary options modify how the primary option is performed.
$! Note that secondary options apply to particular primary options,
$! listed below.  If more than one secondary is desired, separate them by
$! commas so the entire list is in a single parameter.
$!
$! Secondary options are:
$! COMPile,ALL:
$!   DEBug      Compile for debug               (/debug/noopt)
$!   PROfile    Compile for PCA                 (/debug)
$!   LISt       Generate a list file            (/list)
$!   LISTALL    Generate a full list            (/show=all)   (implies LIST)
$! CLEAN:
$!   OBJ        Delete object and list files, and purge executable (default)
$!   SRC        Delete source and make files
